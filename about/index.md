## The boring details

I currently work at [Murex SAS](http://www.murex.com) where reconciling finance with technology is a never ending battle since joining Murex's Paris office back in 2010. Earlier, I worked in the [Dermandar](http://www.dermandar.com) startup trying to make panoramas friendlier to the general public.

I'm passionate about AI and VR technologies, as well as the gaming industry , but mostly about how all three fit together to make amazing products.

*I'm also a gamer quite good at "wasting time" playing games, most recently Blizzard's Overwatch*
